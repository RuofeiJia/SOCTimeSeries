This repository contains the complete data and code for manuscript “A large global soil carbon sink informed by repeated soil samplings”

It contains all the data and scripts to replicate results presented in main text and all figures and tables.

Large files such as spatial data and intermediate results are not saved in this repository due to storage space limitation, but they can be generated by running the scripts included.

All scripts were run in R Version 4.3.2


“data” folder contains

	⁃	region_division_df.rda
	⁃	Dataframe with region division modified from Pan et al. (2024). It was used to generate proportion_decade_df.rda
	⁃	Each row contain centered lat, centered long, region name of a 0.5 degree pixel.

	⁃	SOC_time_series_database.rda
	⁃	The complete database of SOC time series without processing and cleaning. It is generated in 01_process_input_data.R
	⁃	Description in SOC_time_series_database_metadata.csv

	⁃	SOC_time_series_for_analysis.rda
	⁃	Processed dataset used for analysis of this manuscript
	⁃	Description in SOC_time_series_for_analysis_metadata.csv

	⁃	Other files not included in this repository can be generated by running 00_download_prepare_spatial_data.R and 01_process_input_data.R in order

“results” folder contains

	⁃	TRENDY_v12_global_cSoil_S2_20250114.csv
	⁃	Estimates of global soil C stock during 1770-2023 from individual models of TRENDYv12 (S2 simulation).
	⁃	Code that generated these results are available at https://github.com/yinonbaron/SOC_change_TRENDYv12/tree/main

	⁃	SOC_change_table.xlsx
	⁃	All main and supplementary tables generated from scripts Tables_all.R
	⁃	It also contains data used to visualize Fig. 3C

	⁃	Other files not included in this repository can be generated by running 02_analysis.R, 03_prediction.R, 04_upscale.R in order

“scripts” folder contains
	⁃	00_download_prepare_spatial_data.R
	⁃	Script used to download and process all spatial data

	⁃	01_process_input_data.R
	⁃	Script that processes the raw database (SOC_time_series_database.rda) into dataset ready for statistical analysis (SOC_time_series_for_analysis.rda)
	⁃	Outputs “SOC_time_series_for_analysis.rda”

	⁃	02_analysis.R
	⁃	First half of script conducts Wilcoxon test on the soil C rate of change between young and old forests
	⁃	Second half of script fits Bayesian GAMM model to available SOC time series in SOC_time_series_for_analysis.rda
	⁃	Outputs “gamm_brms12.rda”

	⁃	03_prediction.R
	⁃	Script that uses the GAMM to predict SOC change per area at pixel level during 1992-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2020, and 1992-2020
	⁃	Outputs “prediction_result.rda” (unsaved), “prediction_inputs.rda”

	⁃	04_upscale.R
	⁃	First half of script upscales pixel level predictions into regional and global estimates of SOC changes.
	⁃	Second half of script used the upscaled results to estimate forest SOC sink (shown in Fig. 3B), SLAND_soil (shown in Table 2), and natural SOC sink excluding tropical forests and boreal grasslands (mentioned in “Evaluating global estimates”)
	⁃	Outputs “upscaled_regional_summary.RData”, “upscaled_regional_predictions.RData”, “upscaled_pixel_summary.RData”

	⁃	Figure1.R, Figure2.R, Figure3.R, Figures_supplementary
	⁃	Scripts that generate main and supplementary figures

	⁃	Tables_all.R
	⁃	Scrip that generates all main and supplementary tables
